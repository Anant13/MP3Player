/////////////////////MP3 PLAYER///////////////////////////

Hi guys,
I'm Anant Sharma ^.^
I have developed this application so I could demonstrate some amazing functions of java using Java Media Framework(JMF).

///////About MP3.jar//////////////////////////

It is a very basic mp3 player which can also play mpeg format I guess(never tried).
It consist of buttons which performs several functions like "play" the song,"resume","stop" and "pause" the song.
You can also use "choose" option to select the location of your mp3 file.
I am very well aware of every bug this application has,but due to lack of time and sake of simiplicity , I chose to skip those issues and I may work on those when I ll build another media application.
********************************(Loop(L) button doesn't work)*************************************
Thankyou guys,
Sorry I m new to development but i ll keep on improving.
